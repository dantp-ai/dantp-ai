### Hi there üëã,

My name is Daniel. I graduated with a Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently contributing to the tianshou RL framework.
- üëØ I‚Äôm always looking to collaborate on AI and RL projects that are in line with my tenets below.

### About me

I am an experienced machine learning (research) engineer with more than four years of industry experience.

My computer science background has profoundly shaped my understanding of the world in terms of computing and information processing systems. What excites me about the future of technology and humanity is the development of AI with ever-increasing capabilities.

I‚Äôm interested in developing data-driven (or even more powerful, experience-based) computational algorithms that can optimize existing solutions to highly complex sequential decision problems, or find novel solutions to problems that have not yet been attempted.

I have come to understand that the general goal-achieving ability of AI scales extremely well as more computation becomes available and as the data used is collected by the agent itself as it interacts with the world.

In my work, I strive to find the right balance between pragmatism and accuracy. I am incredibly honored to look at the data involved in a process, as it is one of the most grounded truths.

> I love enabling users to make easier, faster and more reliable decisions.

I am fond of RL engineering: What could be more exciting than developing intelligent computational agents that learn how to make ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù sequential decisions in this highly complex world we live in?
